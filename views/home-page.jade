        | Why You Should Use It
      p.lead
        strong #{title} 
        | is a starting point providing a sensible, configurable, and customizable set of choices.
        | You get a turnkey web app that provides common patterns such as environment-specific configuration files,
        | clustering for multiple cores, SSL certificate setup, database connections, logging transports,
        | and caching and compression of content.
      p.lead
        | The experience of building a production-ready, deployable web application 
        | involves making many choices: which technologies, what configuration settings, best practices, etc.
        | While there is no one right set of choices, these are ones I have used in my own production 
        | web application and have found to be not only pragmatic and scalable, but a pleasure to work with.
        | My hope is this might help you get off the ground fast so you can focus on building that awesome idea
        | you've got in your head.
